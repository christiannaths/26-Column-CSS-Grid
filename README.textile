h1. 26 Column CSS Grid

h5. based on Blueprint CSS

---

A 26 Column CSS grid for HTML layouts which gives you 2 'extra' columns for padding and 24 columns for content, which can be neatly divided into 2, 3, 4, & 6 columns. Columns are based on 25px width + 12px gutter dimensions, giving a total page width of 950px.

This repo includes:

* grid.css => the css file
* grid.png => a tile-able .png image which can be overlaid in the background of any element (typically .container) by adding the .showgrid class
* Grids.atn => an Adobe Photoshop action to quickly create a new .psd for you design compositions
* sample_layout.html => a very simple use case example
